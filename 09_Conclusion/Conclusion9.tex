\section{Summary}

The primary results of this thesis as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We made a review of existing modern methods of Web Extraction, considered all main complementary tasks of Information Extraction problem and listed work related to social events extraction.   
    \item We developed the original system which collects training examples for an event extraction problem with the use of Microdata semantic markup.
    \item Hence, we automatically created the training labeled dataset which contains various features including textual, DOM-related, spatial and visual.
    \item We performed extensive cleaning procedure on the original dataset what reduced the number of records dramatically.
    \item We engineered many features from original CSS properties, textual field and spatial coordinates  (X and Y coordinates of the web element). 
    \item We made comprehensive exploratory data analysis including visualization of extracted features for every event component and their relationships, dimensionality reduction and clustering.
    \item We built several binary classification models for every event component, optimized parameters for every model, evaluated them and presented comparison tables. 
\end{enumerate}
