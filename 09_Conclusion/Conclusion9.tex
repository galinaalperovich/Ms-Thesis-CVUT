\subsection{Summary / TODO}

After we had created the dataset we performed the following procedures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Comprehensive exploratory data analysis including visualization of extracted features for every event component.
    \item We performed feature engineering to extract useful information from text features, spatial features (X and Y coordinates of the web element) and visual features (CSS). 
    \item Since we will work with several hundred features, we run dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods. 
    \item We built several models for binary classification tasks, optimized parameters for every model and presented comparison tables.  
    \item We evaluated the models on previously unseen data.    
\end{enumerate}
