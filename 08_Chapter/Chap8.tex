\chapter{Experimental part: Models and evaluation / TODO}
\label{chap:model}
In this chapter we will experiment with the different classification models. We will consider RandomForest, SVM, XGBoost and Logistic regression for comparison. Also we will analyze the feature importance for every event component.\\

Also we will do several manipulation before model building the modal, namely standartisation and fair splitting. By fair we mean that to the train set

To gather the feaature importance we will use Random Forest classifiers which automatically calculate importance based on
