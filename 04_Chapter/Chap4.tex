First of all, for solving the problem of event extraction we need to create a well labeled dataset. The training set collecting is the main stumbling block in the tasks like this. Search engines and big corporation working on this task can easily afford the huge labeled dataset with the high quality. For example, Google hires several companies where hundreds or thousands of people are labeling the data as the full-time job. For researchers, it is much more challenging, and since the quality of the algorithm is directly tied to the quality of data it took as an input, it is very important to find such dataset.
