The Internet is massive data source which is mostly unstructured from the semantic point of view. Despite the fact there are many attempts to unify the way how information is presented there is still no general format for it. For the computer program it is easy to read the Web page as HTML code but it is hard to understand the meaning and extract the semantic structure. It makes the automatic information extraction be the challenging problem. \\

Automatic extraction of the information from Web pages is a common task in data mining. It is used in many familiar services as Web search, news clustering and other such called vertical search services. Web extraction is also widely used in research specially in natural language analysis area. \\
