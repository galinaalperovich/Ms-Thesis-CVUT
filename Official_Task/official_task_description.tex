\chapter*{Sociopath - automatic local events extractor}

The task is to develop a framework which automatically analyses and extracts information on local event announcements (e.g., concerts, lectures, festivals, performances etc.) by means of HTML page analysis.
\\
\\
\textbf {The main tasks:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Study the state of the art approaches for structural information mining from the Web.
\item Develop original or customize existing method for local events mining which will be scalable, stable and precise.
\item Collect an annotated dataset for learning.
\item Extract the most efficient features from the web page required for the learning algorithm.
\item Experiment with different methods and features in order to get the best results. 
\end{itemize}
\\
\textbf {The following methods will be considered in this work:}

\begin{itemize}
\item various DOM-related techniques for HTML-page processing,
\item classification learning algorithms and probabilistic approaches for information extraction,
\item DOM-analysis and natural language processing methods for feature extraction.
\end{itemize}
